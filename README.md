## Introduction

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer app repository! This application is designed to help you visualize various sorting algorithms in action. Built using Next.js and TypeScript, this interactive tool allows you to input your own data or use existing test cases, view the algorithm's code, control the visualization speed, and pause at any point to observe the sorting process in detail.

üåê Visit [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://algo-visualizer-one.vercel.app/)

## Features
+ Algorithm Selection: Choose from a selection of popular sorting algorithms.
+ Custom Input: Input your own array for visualization.
+ Test Cases: Use predefined test cases to observe algorithms on specific scenarios.
+ Code Display: View the sorting algorithm's code implementation.
+ Visualization Controls: Adjust the visualization speed and pause/resume the process.

## Algorithms Included
+ Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
+ Selection Sort: An in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items to be sorted.
+ Insertion Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
+ Quick Sort: A highly efficient and widely used sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer strategy.
+ Shell Sort: A generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.
+ Heap Sort: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.

## Technologies Used
+ Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript
